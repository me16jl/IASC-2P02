# IASC-2P02 | Minhal Enam

## Bio

My name is Minhal Enam. I was born and raised in Saudi Arabia. I am 22 years old. I am an Interactive Media student in Brock University. This is my second year. My area of research is cultural studies and photography, and my research program involves understanding the cultural status between the old and the newness of the object. This research focus is reflected in my projects with an example of daguerreotype which is the first imaging process in the history of photography and how the object carried a social movement in the 1800s. I will also be reviewing text visualization tool that I used in my collaborative project. Combining social and political context in digital humanity will help me to understand the infrastructure of everyday things in a clear manner. This portfolio will enable me to explore my inner interest towards cultural studies and digital humanity. However, this portfolio does demonstrate the areas of cultural studies through daguerreotypes which I will further explain in my featured project. Overall, I would like continue with this work in the future by looking at other objects related to media and photography and how using these objects are vital for our times.
